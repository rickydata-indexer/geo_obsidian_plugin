# Geo Obsidian Plugin

## Next Steps

- [ ] setup correct ontology in Notion
- [ ] setup correct example page that fits the correct ontology framework in obsidian
- [ ] create an obsidian plugin which can move data automatically from obsidian to Notion and keep the two in sync
- [ ] wait for Geo mainnet L3 to become available, and swap out the Notion integration with Geo

## Waiting on being able to write to mainnet L3

## Context
create an obsidian plugin that allows a user to sync their obsidian page with Geo by clicking a button. I saw this plugin by the folks at DeSci which gives me the confirmation you can automate on-chain actions. I have moved over to obsidian instead of roam research because I have understood the crazy amount of potential and freedom available when building obsidian plugins. It's extremely easy to do stuff like pull data using GraphQL, took me no time at all to get that working, and the code for the DeSci plugin is publicly available here and gives us the tools to automate writing onchain.
